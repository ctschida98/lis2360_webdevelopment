                                <td>Studies have shown that gray matter, the processing area, in the brain shrinks with extended screen time. The frontal lobe which controls, planing, prioritizing, organizing, & impulse control can also be affected. The <em>insula</em> area allows for empathy & compassion and excess screen time can damage this area as well and ruin the abililty to form relationships.</td>

For example, studies have shown that dopamine is released while playing video games which creates a craving for the game which is similar to craving drugs.
