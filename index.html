        <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
        
        <!-- Caroline Tschida 09/19/2018 -->
        
        <p>Social media has not been around for very long but it has taken over our world ever since its debut. Suprisingly, social media has been around since the late 70s with Usenet being the first social media-like feature. Usenet was an online bulletin borad that allowed user access to download and upload software and data. Usenet meets today's standards as social media networking. When we think about "social media" we typically picture the first network(s) being MySpace, Facebook, Instant Messengar, etc. however it is so much more than that.
        <p>Today, we have blogs and YouTube, LinkedIn (which actually started in 2003 but has become increasingly popular in recent years), VSCO, Instagram. etc that we are all apart of to stay connnected. Also, social media is now a major part of marketing for brands and companies. Ads can be created to be featured on virtually any social media networking app. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are full of ads all the time that are usually catered to an individuals' interests. Without social media, ads primary be on billboards and radio commericals and TV commericals. Social media also helps to get out information fast to its customers.
        <p>Everyone born after 2000 really does not know a world in which social media does not exist. It is a growing field that gets more and more exciting when a new networking app gets released. Since the release of mobile cell phones, social networking apps are available at the touch of a button. At one point, you could only access Facebook using its website but since the introduction of apps it is way faster to connect. Cell phone apps provide very easy access to them which can be a good and a bad thing. It is good because it allows us to not only connect with friends and family here, but other news and people all over the world. Technologically speaking, social media has brought us very far. However, with pros there are bound to be cons.
        <p>Social media is constantly being pushed in our faces. There is nothing wrong with the use of social media however there is a problem when it becomes an addiction. I would definitely consider myself addicted to my phone and social media. When I am bored or taking a break from class you will find me scrolling through many of my favorite apps.
